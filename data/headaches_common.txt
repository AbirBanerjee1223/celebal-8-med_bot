# Common Headaches: Types, Symptoms, and Home Care

## What is a Headache?
A headache is a pain in any region of the head. Headaches can be unilateral (affecting one side) or bilateral (affecting both sides), isolated to a certain location, or diffuse. They can appear as sharp pains, throbbing aches, or dull throbs. Headaches are a common ailment and can range from mild to severe.

## Common Types of Headaches

### Tension Headaches
* **Description:** These are the most common type of headache. They often feel like a tight band around the head, or a dull, aching pain all over the head.
* **Symptoms:**
    * Dull, aching head pain
    * Sensation of tightness or pressure across your forehead, on the sides, and/or back of your head
    * Tenderness on your scalp, neck, and shoulder muscles
* **Causes:** Stress, anxiety, poor posture, teeth grinding, fatigue.
* **Duration:** Can last from 30 minutes to several days.

### Migraine Headaches
* **Description:** Migraines are intense, throbbing headaches that can last for hours or even days. They are often accompanied by other symptoms.
* **Symptoms:**
    * Moderate to severe pain, often on one side of the head, but can be on both.
    * Throbbing or pulsating sensation.
    * Sensitivity to light (photophobia), sound (phonophobia), and sometimes smell.
    * Nausea and vomiting.
    * Aura: Some people experience visual disturbances (flashing lights, zigzags) before a migraine.
* **Causes:** Genetics, certain triggers (stress, specific foods, caffeine withdrawal, sleep changes, hormonal changes).
* **Duration:** Typically 4 to 72 hours.

### Cluster Headaches
* **Description:** These are rare but extremely severe headaches. They occur in "clusters" (periods of frequent attacks) and are usually unilateral, often around the eye.
* **Symptoms:**
    * Excruciating pain, usually behind or around one eye, or in the temple.
    * Pain is sharp, burning, or piercing.
    * Associated symptoms on the affected side: tearing, redness of the eye, stuffy or runny nose, sweating on the face, drooping eyelid, swelling around the eye.
    * Restlessness or agitation.
* **Causes:** Unknown, but often linked to abnormalities in the hypothalamus. Triggers can include alcohol and smoking.
* **Duration:** Typically 15 minutes to 3 hours.

## General Home Care for Headaches
* **Rest in a quiet, dark room.**
* **Apply a cold or warm compress** to your forehead or neck.
* **Hydrate:** Drink plenty of water.
* **Over-the-counter pain relievers:** Acetaminophen (paracetamol) or ibuprofen can help for tension headaches. Follow dosage instructions.
* **Caffeine:** A small amount of caffeine can sometimes help, but overuse can lead to withdrawal headaches.
* **Stress Management:** Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.
* **Identify and avoid triggers:** Keep a headache diary to identify potential triggers.
