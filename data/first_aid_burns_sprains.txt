# Basic First Aid: Minor Burns and Sprains

## First Aid for Minor Burns (First-Degree Burns)

A first-degree burn affects only the outermost layer of skin, causing redness and mild pain. Second-degree burns involve blistering, and third-degree burns are deep and may appear charred or white. This guide is for minor burns only. For second-degree burns larger than 2-3 inches, or any third-degree burn, seek immediate medical attention.

**Steps:**
1.  **Cool the Burn:** Immediately hold the burned area under cool (not cold or icy) running water for 10-20 minutes. This helps reduce pain and swelling. Do not use ice, as it can cause further tissue damage.
2.  **Remove Tight Items:** Gently remove rings or other tight items from the burned area before it swells.
3.  **Cover the Burn:** Once cooled, cover the burn with a sterile, non-adhesive bandage or a clean cloth. Do not apply butter, oil, or any home remedies, as they can trap heat and increase infection risk.
4.  **Pain Relief:** Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (paracetamol) or ibuprofen can help manage pain.
5.  **Protect from Infection:** Keep the area clean and avoid breaking any blisters that might form (for second-degree burns).
6.  **When to Seek Medical Attention:**
    * If the burn is larger than your palm.
    * If the burn causes blisters (second-degree) and is on the face, hands, feet, major joints, or genitals.
    * Any third-degree burn (looks black, white, or charred, skin may be numb).
    * If signs of infection develop (increased pain, redness, swelling, pus).
    * If the person is very young, elderly, or has a compromised immune system.

## First Aid for Sprains (Minor)

A sprain is a stretch or tear of a ligament, the tough bands of fibrous tissue that connect two bones together in your joints. Sprains are common and range from mild to severe. This guide is for minor sprains (Grade 1 - mild stretching of ligament). For severe pain, inability to bear weight, or significant deformity, seek medical attention.

**Common Symptoms of a Sprain:**
* Pain around the affected joint.
* Swelling.
* Bruising.
* Limited ability to move the joint.

**RICE Method for Sprains (and Strains):**
Immediately apply the RICE method:
1.  **Rest:** Avoid using the injured body part. Stop any activity that causes pain.
2.  **Ice:** Apply an ice pack (wrapped in a cloth) to the injured area for 15-20 minutes at a time, every 2-3 hours for the first 24-48 hours. This helps reduce swelling and pain.
3.  **Compression:** Gently compress the injured area with an elastic bandage (like an Ace bandage) to help reduce swelling. Don't wrap it too tightly, as this can cut off circulation.
4.  **Elevation:** Elevate the injured area above the level of your heart, especially when sleeping. This also helps reduce swelling.

**Additional Care:**
* **Pain Relief:** Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help manage pain and inflammation.
* **When to See a Doctor:**
    * If you can't bear weight on the injured joint.
    * If the pain is severe and doesn't improve with RICE.
    * If the joint appears deformed or significantly bruised.
    * If you hear a "pop" at the time of injury.
    * If numbness or tingling occurs.
