# Common Cold - Symptoms and Care

## What is the Common Cold?
The common cold is a viral infection of your nose and throat (upper respiratory tract). It's usually harmless, although it might not feel that way. Many different types of viruses can cause a common cold.

## Common Cold Symptoms
Symptoms of a common cold usually appear 1 to 3 days after exposure to a cold-causing virus. Symptoms may include:
* Runny or stuffy nose
* Sore throat
* Cough
* Congestion
* Slight body aches or mild headache
* Sneezing
* Low-grade fever (uncommon in adults, more frequent in children)
* Malaise (a general feeling of being unwell)

## Duration of Common Cold
A common cold usually lasts 7 to 10 days. Symptoms might peak around day 2-3 and then gradually improve. Coughs can linger for up to 2-3 weeks.

## Home Care for Common Cold
There's no cure for the common cold, but you can take steps to relieve your symptoms:
* **Rest:** Get plenty of sleep.
* **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of fluids like water, juice, clear broth, or warm lemon water with honey. Avoid caffeine and alcohol.
* **Sore Throat Relief:** Gargle with warm salt water, use throat lozenges or sprays.
* **Congestion Relief:** Use saline nasal sprays or drops. Over-the-counter decongestants may offer temporary relief.
* **Pain/Fever Relief:** Acetaminophen (paracetamol) or ibuprofen can help.
* **Humidifier:** A cool-mist humidifier can help moisten the air and ease congestion and coughing.

## When to See a Doctor for a Cold
Most colds don't require medical attention. However, see your doctor if you have:
* Fever of 103 F (39.4 C) or higher
* Fever accompanied by sweating, chills and a cough
* Significant sinus pain
* Shortness of breath or wheezing
* Severe sore throat or headache
* Symptoms that worsen or don't improve after 10 days
* Any new symptoms or concerns.
